# Demo Site


This is my first attempt to creaete a HTML

This mark down file will also serve as a place to practice my markdown syntax

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

**this text is bold**
*this text is italic*
--this is strikethrough text--

>This text is a quote

To make text appear as code we use `backticks` and it will change the apperance of the contained words

```triple backticks creates a block of code```
